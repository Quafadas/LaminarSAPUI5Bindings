This is a bootlegged repository based on the excellent
https://github.com/sherpal/LaminarSAPUI5Bindings

It is bootlegged because I want to consume it through a CDN.

https://github.com/sherpal/LaminarSAPUI5Bindings/pull/87

https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents/discussions/9487

https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/8427

And doing that would essentially break the default use case of the original repository.
